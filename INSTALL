We're in process of moving our development to Github more news soon (this will only replace points 1-2)

Prerequisities:
Download and install Tcl/Tk for your platform. We recommend ActiveTCL. NOTE: use 8.4 version only, we're not updated to use 8.5 !!!!

1. Install subversion control

Install an SVN client, we recommend free TortoiseSVN for Windows, e.g. http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads 

2. Checkout the 3D-PTV project from origo

- Prepare an empty folder on your hard drive, for example D:\svn-ptv. 
- Right click this folder and then select SVN checkout.... 
- As URL of repository we recommend to use either https://svn.origo.ethz.ch/ptv/branches/stable_Sept09 or https://svn.origo.ethz.ch/ptv/. 
- The former is tested and stable and the latter guaranties that you will always have the latest version.

- If you use the trunk version make sure that whenever you work again with 3D-PTV right-click your D:\svn-ptv folder and update it to the most current version. 
- If you make a useful modification to the code yourself use the SVN Update function and we will all profit from it. You may also choose to create a branch so you can develop your own version of the code.

3. Download the project file
http://ptv.origo.ethz.ch/system/files/3dptv.vcproj

- Download (by right-clicking, Save Link As...) the project file  and store it inside the src_c folder. 

4. Set two paths in the project settings

- Open the project and in the <Solution Explorer> at the top of the file tree you will see 3D-PTV. Right-click it and go to Configuration Porperties->Debugging->Command Arguments/Working Directory. Enter the paths according to your file structure that they point to ptv.tcl and the the folder where you have your folders res, img, parameters and cal.
